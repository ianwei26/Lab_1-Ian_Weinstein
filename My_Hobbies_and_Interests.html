    <h3>My interests:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="cool">Baseball</li>
        <p>I've been playing baseball since I was 5 and it is by far my favorite and now my only sport that I play. 
        I pitch and play outfield. 
        My strengths are my speed, my ability to hit for contact and power, and my fastball velocity.
        </p>
        <li>Business</li>
        <p>I am in ABF at BCA and I hope to continue to study business in college and eventually start a career in a related area.</p>
        <li>Whenever I'm free I try to spend time with friends and family.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>My hobbies:</h3>
